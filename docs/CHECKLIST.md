## First steps

- ✅ Create a repository in your team using this template repo
- Choose a license and update the LICENSE file accordingly (default is GPL-3.0-or-later). 
- ✅ Edit this CHECKLIST.md file and use it as the main location of your technical documentation with links out to other information contained under `/docs/`.
- ✅ Create a `/docs/` directory for more elaborate documentation of your API, planning notes, etc.Make sure that all of your team members have access to the repository.
- ✅ Create a project under the **Projects** tab. Use this to manage your planning. Create a To-do list, etc. Explore the tools available and use them to manage your project.
- ✅ Assign team roles and include a listing of those roles in this CHECKLIST.md file or in another file under `/docs/`.
- Then put your entire development workflow in this repository.
- Assign ONE approver to maintain the package and merge pull requests.
- Create **forks** to add basic structure, files, and to develop features. Be mindful to not run over each other's code.
- Use **Pull requests** to propose changes and incorporate them into your code from various team members. 
- Use **Issues** to identify and track bugs and also to communicate about various aspects of the project.

## Next steps
1. Brainstorm (no ideas are bad) and DOCUMENT the brainstorming.
2. Refine an idea into a plan (And DOCUMENT this process)
3. Set a scope of work (what can you feasibly develop in the second half of the semester? Document this!)
4. Develop a roadmap (Create a project board to document your process)
5. Assign tasks (DOCUMENT who is doing what)
6. Start building components (COMMENT and DOCUMENT your code)
7. Test and review components before you merge them into the main branch of your project (Use the review to document this) 
8. Fork, develop features, and merge (and DOCUMENT all versions. See a theme here?)
9. Demo your project. 
10. Assemble your final documentation.
11. Clean up code and create a release.
12. Create a pull request to post a link to your project and your demo the demo repo: https://github.com/comp426-2023-spring/a99-project-demo/

## Expectations

The expectations for this project is something along the lines of a working prototype.
It does not have to be beautiful, it just has to work for the most part (sort of).
And it does not have to be feature rich, it just has to do some pretty basic things (though more advanced features are a place for you to flex your skills).

I expect and encourage inter-team collaboration as well.
If there is something that your team finds useful: create a discussion in our class organization about it!

The repositories for this project will be created under the course organization as open source.
This is intentional to encourage you to share things and learn from what your peers are doing.  

Finally, be creative!

This doesn't mean that what you build has to be earth-shattering.
It can be whatever your team wants it to be.

AND it can serve as a portfolio piece if you plan accordingly.

So, BE CREATIVE, and do interesting things!
