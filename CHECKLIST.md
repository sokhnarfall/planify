# a99 Checklist

## First steps

1. Create a repository in your team using this template repo
2. Choose a license and update the LICENSE file accordingly (default is GPL-3.0-or-later). 
3. Edit this CHECKLIST.md file and use it as the main location of your technical documentation with links out to other information contained under `/docs/`.
4. Create a `/docs/` directory for more elaborate documentation of your API, planning notes, etc.
5. Make sure that all of your team members have access to the repository.
6. Create a project under the **Projects** tab. Use this to manage your planning. Create a To-do list, etc. Explore the tools available and user them to manage your project.
7. Assign team roles and include a listing of those roles in this CHECKLIST.md file or in another file under `/docs/`.
8. Then put your entire development workflow in this repository.
9. Assign ONE approver to maintain the package and merge pull requests.
10. Create **forks** to add basic structure, files, and to develop features. Be mindful to not run over each other's code.
11. Use **Pull requests** to propose changes and incorporate them into your code from various team members. 
12. Use **Issues** to identify and track bugs and also to communicate about various aspects of the project.

## Team mangement 

Plan to meet with your team ASAP.
Talk through identifying roles within your team.

Try to figure out what each of you are good at/enjoy doing and try to work out roles that incorporate that.

Some basic roles you will want to consider:

1. A review manager - someone to review pull requests and merge or reject them and manage the related discussions
2. A plan manager - someone to keep an eye on the overall plan and keep the project tab/to-do list up to date
3. A documentation manager - someone to keep the documentation in order and identify what is missing and needs to be documented
4. A release manager - someone to manage the packaging and release process for your prototype package
5. A project manager - someone keeping track of all the moving parts and make sure that everything that needs to happen is happening
5. Roles for team members to take charge or different parts of the project. Possible roles:
    1. Front end lead
    2. Back end lead
    3. Database lead
    4. Design lead
    5. Etc.

You will notice that there are more roles than people in your group.
That is because you will all be doing a hybrid job of managing a thing while working on other things.

## Next steps

1. Brainstorm (no ideas are bad) and DOCUMENT the brainstorming.
2. Refine an idea into a plan (And DOCUMENT this process)
3. Set a scope of work (what can you feasibly develop in the second half of the semester? Document this!)
4. Develop a roadmap (Create a project board to document your process)
5. Assign tasks (DOCUMENT who is doing what)
6. Start building components (COMMENT and DOCUMENT your code)
7. Test and review components before you merge them into the main branch of your project (Use the review to document this) 
8. Fork, develop features, and merge (and DOCUMENT all versions. See a theme here?)
9. Demo your project. 
10. Assemble your final documentation.
11. Clean up code and create a release.
12. Create a pull request to post a link to your project and your demo the demo repo: https://github.com/comp426-2023-spring/a99-project-demo/

## Go!

And that is about all you need to get started.

Good skill and be creative!
