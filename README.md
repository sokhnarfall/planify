# Planify
Get organized with planify! Planify is a website that allows you to organize tasks and prioritize them by urgency. Users can set specififc time frames for a list of taks and cross them off once they are completed.

## Demo
- Your team will create a <= 3-minute video describing your app to present to the class about your app.
This can be a very basic walkthrough, or a description/presentation of features/use cases, or something else.
Be creative.
Think of it as an opportunity to hone your ability to pitch an idea that you have in prototype (because that is what it is).
- In order to get credit for this, add a row to the table in the README here and make a pull request: https://github.com/comp426-20223-spring/a99-demos/edit/main/README.md

## Set Up Instructions
You can find more information about our website under `planify/docs/get-started.md` but below are basic instructions to get the website up and running assuming you already have the prerequisites outlined in the `get-started.md` file.
- Your project should take the form of a Node package, with all of the attendant items associated with that.
The following three script commands should work in your package:

1. `npm install` - Install dependencies for your package.
2. `npm test` - Start app, check that everything can run, and then stop app.
3. `npm run` - Command to bring up all parts of the app/system's server scripts.
