# Planify
Get organized with planify! Planify is a website that allows you to organize tasks and prioritize them by urgency. Users can set specififc time frames for a list of taks and cross them off once they are completed.

## Demo
- Your team will create a <= 3-minute video describing your app to present to the class about your app.
This can be a very basic walkthrough, or a description/presentation of features/use cases, or something else.
Be creative.
Think of it as an opportunity to hone your ability to pitch an idea that you have in prototype (because that is what it is).
